This is a simple **Movie Search App** that allows users to search for movies using the **OMDb API** (Open Movie Database). By entering a movie title in the search box and submitting the form, the app fetches and displays relevant information about the movie, including its **title**, **rating**, **genre**, **release date**, **runtime**, **actors**, **plot**, and **poster** image. If no movie is found, the app will notify the user with an error message.
